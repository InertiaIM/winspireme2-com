    <p><strong>Counter-Notice and Replacement of Material</strong></p>

    <h2 style="padding-right:238px; margin-bottom:27px;">TRADEMARK USAGE GUIDELINES</h2>
    
    <p>Winspire’s trademarks, service marks and trade dress (collectively, “Trademarks”) are valuable intellectual property assets, and they should only be used pursuant to Winspire’s Trademark Usage Guidelines.  Nothing in these Guidelines grants the right to use any Winspire Trademarks in any manner or to acquire any domain names that include any Winspire Trademarks.  These Trademark Usage Guidelines may be modified by Winspire from time to time, in Winspire’s sole discretion.  Licensees of Winspire and other third parties may be subject to additional use restrictions.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Use of Winspire Trademarks</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Winspire Trademarks should only be used to refer to Winspire products and services, and only in a manner that is true, accurate, not misleading and fair.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The Winspire company logo and its trade dress should not be used without the company’s express written authorization.  Likewise, its trademarks and service marks should not be used in their stylized form without the company’s express written authorization; they should be used only in standard text with initial caps or all caps.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The Winspire Trademarks should be presented in a manner that makes them stand out from the text around them, such as in initial caps or all caps.  Use an appropriate trademark symbol and/or trademark acknowledgement of Winspire’s ownership of the Trademarks.  Use ™ for unregistered marks or ® for registered marks, and/or use the following form of acknowledgement:  “WINSPIRE and the company logo are trademarks of Winspire.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Do not use a Winspire Trademark as a noun, in a plural form, or in a possessive form.  A Winspire Trademark should not be used in a generic or descriptive fashion.  A Trademark should be used as an adjective, followed by the appropriate noun, such as:  WINSPIRE services make your auction a great success.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Do not incorporate Winspire Trademarks into marks of other companies, organizations or individuals, do not modify the Trademarks in any manner, and do not join the Trademarks together to other words, names, symbols, numbers or phrases.  The Trademarks should not be translated into another language</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Winspire Trademarks</strong></p>
    
    <p>Winspire is developing new products and services, and anticipates that it will launch new trademarks, service marks and trade dress designs in the future.  Winspire Trademarks currently include, but are not limited to:</p>
